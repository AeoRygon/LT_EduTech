AIM OF THE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to predict heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms
UNIQUENESS/DIFFERENTIATOR TRIED OUT IN THE PROJECT
SVM model has been tried as a new methodology with existing model
INFERENCE
The tries out SVM model has less accuracy (0.74) than the Random forest classifier (0.79)
METRICS OF THE PROJECT 
Model accuracy for Logistic regression: 0.77
Model accuracy for Random forest classifier: 0.79
Model accuracy for KNeighbors Classifier: 0.70
Model accuracy for SVM: 0.74
